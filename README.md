Introduction Project Overview Bike-sharing systems have become an increasingly popular mode of sustainable transportation in cities around the world. These systems allow users to rent bikes for short trips, promoting eco-friendly travel and reducing urban congestion. In this project, I explore and analyze bike-sharing data to uncover patterns in bike usage and gain insights into how different factors, such as time of day, weather, and seasonality, affect ridership. This analysis aims to provide data-driven insights that can help improve bike-sharing operations and potentially guide decisions in urban planning and resource allocation.

Objectives The main goals of this project are to:

Analyze Patterns in Bike Usage: Identify trends in daily and hourly bike rentals, and understand how usage varies by day of the week, time of day, and across different seasons. Understand External Factors Affecting Demand: Examine the impact of factors like weather, temperature, and humidity on bike usage. Forecast Future Demand: Build and evaluate time series models to predict future demand for bike rentals, enabling better planning and resource management. Dataset This analysis uses a publicly available dataset that contains information on bike rentals, including timestamped records of the number of bikes rented, as well as weather and temperature conditions. Each data point includes fields such as:

Datetime: The date and time of the rental record. Count: The number of bikes rented in a specific time interval. Weather Conditions: Indicators for temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy). Holiday & Working Day Flags: Whether the date is a holiday or a regular working day. Analysis Approach This project employs a combination of data visualization, time series analysis, and forecasting techniques. The analysis is structured as follows:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We begin with EDA to visualize and understand the distribution and trends in bike rentals. This includes examining hourly and daily trends, as well as visualizing the effects of weather and other factors on bike demand. Feature Engineering: We create additional features, such as day of the week, month, and seasonal indicators, to capture patterns in the data. Time Series Forecasting: Using time series modeling techniques, we develop and evaluate models to forecast bike rental demand. These models help predict usage patterns, which is valuable for bike availability management. Key Insights and Potential Applications This analysis provides actionable insights that can help bike-sharing companies and city planners optimize bike availability, identify peak usage times, and allocate resources more effectively. Moreover, the forecasting model can be used as a planning tool to meet future demand, especially during peak hours and seasons.

Data Preparation I start by installing and loading necessary libraries like tidyverse, DataExplorer, janitor, and lubridate. The working directory is set to load data for each month from October 2023 to September 2024. I load each monthâ€™s CSV data into separate data frames (bs1 to bs12) and check their structure with glimpse().
Data Merging and Cleaning I merge the data for the 12 months into one large dataset (divvydata) and remove empty rows and columns using the janitor::remove_empty() function. A new date column is created from the started_at column, and additional columns like month, day, year, weekday, start_hour, end_hour, and season are added. The ride_length column is calculated by finding the difference between ended_at and started_at. You convert this into a numeric format.
Data Filtering I clean the dataset by removing rows with missing values or negative ride lengths and exclude rows where start_station_name contains invalid values (e.g., "HQ QR", "CHECK", etc.).
Descriptive Statistics Summary statistics are calculated for ride_length by user type (member_casual) using aggregate(). I summarize the data to explore user type distribution, ride lengths, and ride counts for various time periods and categories.
Trends Analysis Weekday Trends:
I calculate the average ride duration and count of rides by weekday and user type (casual vs. member). A bar plot visualizes the daily ridership by user type, with colors representing the user type. Ride Type Trends:

The dataset is grouped by rideable_type (e.g., bike type) and member_casual to compare casual vs. member usage of different ride types (like "classic bike", "electric bike", etc.). A bar plot visualizes the distribution of ride types across user types. Seasonal Trends:

Seasonal ride distribution is explored, and the average ride duration is calculated for each season (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter) by user type. A bar plot visualizes seasonal ridership trends for each user type. Monthly Trends:

Monthly ridership trends are displayed, broken down by user type, with separate visualizations for total rides and average duration. Hourly Trends:

The code then calculates and visualizes the popular start and end hours for each user type (casual vs. member). Bar plots are created for the top start and end hours, visualizing how users of different types use bikes at different times of the day. Station Trends:

The most popular start and end stations are identified, and visualized separately for casual vs. member users. The top 10 start and end stations are visualized using bar plots to show how ridership is distributed across the city. Summary of Key Visualizations: Weekday Trends: Show the distribution of rides across the days of the week, highlighting which days are most popular for casual riders vs. members. Ride Type Trends: Compare usage of different bike types between casual and member riders. Seasonal Trends: Analyze how seasonality impacts ridership, including average duration. Monthly Trends: Show changes in ride counts and ride durations month-to-month. Hourly Trends: Examine patterns in ride start and end times, providing insights into peak usage hours. Station Trends: Identify the most popular bike stations, both for starting and ending rides.
